# Hello-World
Hello my name is Brandon.  After taking a website design course about a year ago, I realized how much I enjoyed programming, so I decided to begin teaching myself javascript. From there, I have learned about XML, AJAX, SQL, Node.js, JSON, and am now learning Angularjs.  I graduated in December of 2017 with my BS in Business Education with a major in Information Technology.  My eventual goal is to become a full-stack developer.

This repository is for my beginner scripts that I constructed when I was first learning.  They typically show one concept at a time.
