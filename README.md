# Hello-World
Getting Started with GitHub.
Hello my name is Brandon.  After taking a website design course about a year ago, I decided to begin teaching myself javascript.  I have been learning since July, so I am fairly new to programming.  I code inbetween going to school and working.  Once I graduate in December, I hope I can find a job with my new skillset and continue to improve from there.

This repository are for my beginner scripts that I constructed when I was first learning.  They typically show one concept at a time.
